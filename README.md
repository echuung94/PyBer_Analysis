# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this new analysis was to use use our skill and knowledge and use Python and Pandas in order to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Pandas and Matplotlib was then used to create a multiple-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type. Pandas groupby() function was used with the count() and sum() methods to get the total number of rides, driver, and fare for each city type. We then calculated the average fare per ride and fare per driver for each city type. Incorporating Pandas skills along with the functions pivot() and resample(), we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. 

## Results
The table below shows the summary of total rides, drivers, fares and the average fare per ride and driver. The Urban city type had the highest number of total rides and drivers with a total fare amount of $39,854.38. Although the total amount for Urban showed to be the highest, the average fare per ride and per driver showed to be the lowest when compared to Rural and Suburban. Rural had an average fare of $34.62, Suburban had an average fare of $30.97, and Urban with the lowest of $24.53. With Rural areas having the most expensive fares, the analysis shows that the more drivers there are available for a ride service, the cheaper the fare seems to be.</br>
Comparing the three different city types, during week of 01/13/2019, Rural was inconsistent with Suburban and Urban, showing a decrease from the previous week while Suburan and Urban had increased. The average fare for that particular week decreased from $187.92 to $67.65, showing a difference of $120.27. The first high peak that is shown for each city type occurred the week of 02/24/2019. Rural had an average fare of $95.82, Suburban had an average fare of $1,045.50, and Urban had the highest when compared to the other two of $2,235.07. The multiple line chart shows that Urban had several up and down peaks between week 02/24/2019 with an average fare of $2,235.07 and 04/07/2019 with an average fare of $2,356.70. Even though the Rural areas has a higher price range, the company makes more money from rides in the Urban area.

## Summary 
Three business recommendation to address disparities among the city types:</br>
Drivers are very important for the growth of V.Isualize and the more drivers there are in an area, the more rides there will be which would lead to an increase in profits that it will bring in for the company. For example, the rural area has the lowest amount of drivers, leading to a high average fare price and average driver fare price. The company could set a specific amount for each ride in a given city area. Setting a set price could help the consistency of the data when analyzing the company's profits. Obtaining the location and distance for each ride could help V.Isualize make key decisions about where resources and support are needed. The summary shows the city type, drivers, and fare amounts but we are not seeing the distance that each ride is. There could be other attributes as to what sets the price for each ride.
